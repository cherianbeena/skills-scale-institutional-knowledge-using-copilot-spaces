# OctoAcme — Risk Management & Communication

## Purpose
Explain how to identify, manage, and communicate risks and dependencies.

## Risk Register
Maintain a simple table with:
- ID
- Description
- Impact (High/Med/Low)
- Likelihood (High/Med/Low)
- Owner
- Mitigation plan
- Status

## Risk Lifecycle
- Identify: during planning and ongoing execution (Business Analyst, QA Lead, and other key personas contribute)
- Assess: estimate impact and likelihood
- Mitigate: reduced via actions, contingency plans
- Monitor: review at weekly syncs and update status

## Stakeholder & Persona Communication
- Identify stakeholder groups and key personas (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Business Analyst, QA Lead, UX/UI Designer)
- Provide regular updates (weekly or milestone-based)
- Use a single source of truth (project README or release doc) for status

## Communication Templates
Weekly Status Template:
- Progress this week:
- Next steps:
- Risks & blockers (include input from Business Analyst, QA Lead, and other personas):
- Ask / decisions needed:

Incident Communication
- Triage summary
- Actions being taken
- Expected timeline
- Post-incident blameless retrospective scheduled

## Escalation Paths
- Team-level (PM, Scrum Master, QA Lead, relevant personas) -> PM -> Product Lead/Product Owner -> Sponsor/Stakeholders
- For security incidents, follow the security incident runbook and notify Security on-call
