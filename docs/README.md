# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management Docs! This directory contains our complete project management process guides and templates designed to help new team members quickly understand our approach, roles, and key practices.

## Project Management Process Overview

**Core Methodology and Lifecycle:** OctoAcme operates on a customer-first, iterative delivery model built on five core principles: prioritizing customer value and usability, delivering small testable increments, establishing clear ownership, making data-informed decisions, and fostering psychological safety. Projects follow a structured lifecycle that begins with Initiation (validating business need and aligning stakeholders), progresses through Planning (breaking work into shippable increments with defined scope and milestones), moves into Execution (iterative build, test, and review cycles), culminates in Release (deployment and verification), and concludes with Retrospectives (capturing learnings and action items). Key artifacts maintained throughout include a Project Charter, Roadmap and Release Plan, Sprint/Iteration Backlogs with clear acceptance criteria, Risk Registers, and documented retrospective action items.

**Roles and Organizational Structure:** OctoAcme employs a cross-functional team structure with clearly defined roles and responsibilities. Project Managers coordinate delivery activities, manage schedules, risks, and communications to ensure projects stay on track. Product Managers define the product vision, prioritize the backlog, and measure success through data-driven metrics. Developers implement features, collaborate on design and quality, and participate in estimating work while identifying technical risks. QA/Testing teams validate quality against acceptance criteria, and Stakeholders provide critical inputs and approvals. This distributed ownership model ensures accountability while promoting collaboration across engineering, product, and business functions.

**Communication and Risk Management:** OctoAcme maintains a structured communication cadence including weekly syncs between Project and Product Managers, twice-weekly team standups focused on progress and blockers, monthly stakeholder updates, and ad-hoc escalations as needed. Daily standups follow a 15-minute format emphasizing progress, blockers, and dependencies, supplemented by weekly delivery syncs and sprint demos. Risk management is integrated throughout the project lifecycle with a formal Risk Register tracking identification, assessment, mitigation plans, and ongoing monitoring. Communication follows standardized templates including weekly status updates (highlighting progress, next steps, risks, and decisions needed) and incident response protocols ensuring transparency and rapid escalation when needed.

**Quality Assurance and Execution Practices:** Quality is embedded in OctoAcme's execution model through multiple layers of validation and testing. Development follows a pull request workflow with small PRs (≤400 lines), automated testing and linting in CI/CD pipelines, and mandatory peer reviews before merging. Quality assurance encompasses unit tests for new logic, integration tests where applicable, end-to-end smoke tests for critical flows before release, and security scanning in CI. Work progresses through a structured project board with clear states (Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, QA, Done), and teams track velocity, burndown, and success metrics defined in project charters. Blocker escalation follows a tiered approach (team-level triage → PM escalation → sponsor-level escalation) ensuring issues are addressed at the appropriate level while maintaining delivery momentum.

## Key Principles

- **Customer-first:** We prioritize customer value and usability in all decisions
- **Iterative delivery:** We deliver small, testable increments frequently
- **Clear ownership:** Each project has named Project and Product leads
- **Data-informed:** We measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety:** We encourage feedback and create space for learning

For questions or feedback on these processes, reach out to your Project Manager or Product Lead.
